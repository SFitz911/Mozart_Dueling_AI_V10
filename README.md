## üß™ Want to Test It Right Away?

**Check out `TEST_ERRORS.md`** - it contains real coding errors you can copy and paste to see Mozart AI in action! Perfect for:
- Testing the dual AI system
- Learning from common coding mistakes
- Breaking out of AI error loops with Cursor, Claude, etc.
- Seeing how multiple AI perspectives solve problems differently

## üéØ What Does This Do?

Mozart AI is like having two expert programmers review your code at the same time! It uses two different AI systems (OpenAI's GPT-4 and DeepSeek) to:
- ‚úÖ Check your code for bugs and problems
- üí° Suggest improvements to make your code better
- üîí Find security issues that could be dangerous
- üìä Give you detailed scores and explanations

**Think of it like having a friendly coding mentor that never gets tired and always gives detailed feedback!**

## ‚ú® What Can It Check?

Mozart AI can review your code for these important things:

üîç **Correctness** - Does your code actually work correctly?
üîí **Security** - Are there any security vulnerabilities?
‚ö° **Performance** - Could your code run faster?
üìñ **Clarity** - Is your code easy to read and understand?
üîß **Maintainability** - Will it be easy to modify later?
üß† **Logic** - Does the logic make sense?
‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Handling** - Does it handle errors properly?
üß™ **Testing** - Does it need more tests?
üìà **Scalability** - Will it work with lots of data?
üìù **Documentation** - Are there enough comments?
üèóÔ∏è **Design** - Is the code structure good?

## üñ•Ô∏è Easy-to-Use Interface

- **Simple Buttons**: Just click buttons to start reviews
- **Color Coding**: Green = good, Red = needs work, Yellow = in progress
- **Easy Reading**: Results are shown in plain English
- **Copy & Paste**: Easy to copy results to share with others

**Don't worry - you don't need to be a tech expert! Just follow these simple steps:**

### Step 1: Make Sure You Have Python

**What is Python?** Python is a programming language that Mozart AI needs to run.

**Do I have Python?** Let's check:
1. Press `Windows Key + R` on your keyboard
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. In the black window that opens, type: `python --version`
4. If you see something like "Python 3.11.4", you have Python! ‚úÖ
5. If you see an error, you need to install Python ‚ùå

**If you need to install Python:**
1. Go to https://python.org/downloads
2. Click the big yellow "Download Python" button
3. Run the downloaded file
4. **IMPORTANT**: Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" ‚ö†Ô∏è
5. Click "Install Now"

### Step 2: Get Your AI API Keys

**What are API Keys?** Think of them like passwords that let Mozart AI talk to the AI services.

You need two keys:
1. **OpenAI API Key** (for GPT-4)
2. **DeepSeek API Key** (for DeepSeek)

**Getting OpenAI API Key:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Log In"
3. Once logged in, click "API Keys" on the left side
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Copy the key (it starts with "sk-...")
6. **Keep this safe!** You can't see it again

**Getting DeepSeek API Key:**
1. Go to https://platform.deepseek.com
2. Sign up for an account
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Generate a new key
5. Copy and save the key

### Step 3: Run the Easy Setup

**This is the magic part - Mozart AI will set itself up!**

1. **Find Mozart AI folder**: Open File Explorer and navigate to where you downloaded Mozart AI
2. **Open the folder**: You should see files like `setup.py`, `LAUNCH_GUI.bat`, etc.
3. **Right-click** on `setup.py`
4. Choose **"Open with" ‚Üí "Python"** (or just double-click if Python opens .py files)
5. **A window will pop up** - this is the setup wizard! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**In the setup window:**
1. Click "Check Dependencies" (it will install anything missing)
2. Enter your OpenAI API key in the first box
3. Enter your DeepSeek API key in the second box
4. Click "Setup Environment"
5. Wait for it to say "Setup completed successfully!" ‚úÖ
